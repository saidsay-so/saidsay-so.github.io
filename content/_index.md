ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Sayafdine!

I'm a French software engineer, 
currently living in Paris and working at [SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale](https://www.societegenerale.com/en) as a <u>DevOps Cloud Engineer</u>, 
where I maintain an internal PaaS platform based on Kubernetes.

I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) (Paris VI), 
with a specialization in Networks and Software Engineering. 
I've got a solid background in software development, system administration, and cloud computing. 
I've worked on building and maintaining large-scale distributed systems, and I'm deeply passionate about open-source software.

I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow,
so feel free to reach out to me if you think we could work together on something cool!
