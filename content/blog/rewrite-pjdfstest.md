> Your proposal Rewrite PJDFSTest suite has been accepted by Org The FreeBSD Project for GSoC 2022.

So, here we are! My proposal has been accepted, I'm so relieved!
But what this proposal is about, what does it have to do with Rust anyway?
In this post, I will explain what is the project, its current shortcomings and how rewriting it to Rust would solve them.

## What is PJDFSTest?

Let's start with the basics.
[PJDFSTest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest) is a test suite for POSIX system calls.
It is particularly useful to test file systems, and mostly used to this effect.

### Limitations

## Rewrite it in Rust

## Thanks

Thanks to my mentor [asomers](https://github.com/asomers), who will guide me through this journey (and is coincidentally one of nix's maintainers!).
